_Algoim_ is a collection of high-order accurate numerical methods and C++ algorithms for working with implicitly defined geometry and level set methods. Motivated by multi-phase multi-physics applications, particularly those with evolving dynamic interfaces, these algorithms target core, fundamental techniques in level set methods. They have been designed with a view to standard finite difference implementations as well as more advanced finite element and discontinuous Galerkin implementations, multi-threading and massively parallel MPI computation. The collection includes:
- High-order accurate quadrature algorithms for implicitly defined domains in hyperrectangles (such as for computing integrals in curved domains or over curved surfaces)
- High-order accurate closest point calculations to implicitly defined surfaces _(To be added)_
- k-d trees optimized for codimension-one point clouds _(To be added)_
- Accurate level set reinitialization and extension velocity schemes _(To be added)_
- Voronoi implicit interface methods for multi-phase interconnected interface dynamics _(To be added)_

## Prerequisites

Many of the numerical algorithms implemented in Algoim are templated on the spatial dimension `N`, allowing one to develop numerical schemes which operate in any number of spatial dimensions. To assist with this functionality, Algoim makes heavy use of the open source C++ library [blitz++](https://github.com/blitzpp/blitz) for high-performance fixed-length vector arithmetic, via `template<typename T, int N> blitz::TinyVector<T,N>`. In order to use Algoim, [blitz++](https://github.com/blitzpp/blitz) should first be downloaded and configured for your compiler, and installed such that it can be found in the appropriate include directories, i.e., so that `#include <blitz/array.h>` resolves correctly.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/algoim/algoim.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
